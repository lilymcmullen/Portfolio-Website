description: "This post is based on a WFSC223 (Dealing with Data in the Wild) class, and the code I produced during the class. We learned about filtering and summarizing data, creating new columns, choosing the appropriate data visualizations, and performing and interpreting the appropriate statistical tests, in the context of real Palmer Penguin data from Antarctica."
