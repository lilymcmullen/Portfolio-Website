Hi, I'm Lily! I am a second year student at University of Arizona studying natural resources with a concentration in conservation biology, as well as a minor in computer science and a certificate in geographic information systems (GIS). I am interested in conservation, ecological data science and data visualization.

I'm currently studying R and RStudio, Python, Github/Git, ArcGIS Pro, and data science.
