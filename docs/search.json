    "text": "I grew up in Portland, Oregon and quickly developed a love for nature and the outdoors at a young age. Even in middle school, I knew that my future career would have to do with taking care of the planet. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to go on many camping trips and go to outdoor school, which inspired my love for nature. I also nurtured hobbies like horseback riding and gardening, which further connected me with plants and animals.\n\nIn my final year of high school, I attended Portland Community College as a dual-enrollment student. I focused my studies on learning about ecology and how the environment works. During the pandemic, I was able to explore my interests in Computer Science and coding by taking advantage of my elective courses at PCC. I also began to take music more seriously, saving money to buy equipment for performing.\n\nIn Fall of 2022, I moved across the country with only a car full of my things to begin my studies at the U of A. I decided to pursue a major in Natural Resources, focusing on Conservation Biology, as well as a minor in Computer Science and a certificate in GIS. Since then, I have been chasing many opportunities the school has made available for me, while falling in love with the Sonoran desert and finding new places to share my songs.\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn more about me!"
