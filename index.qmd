Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Lily McMullen, and I am a second year student at University of Arizona.

I am studying natural resources with a concentration in conservation biology, as well as a minor in computer science and a certificate in geographic information systems (GIS). I am interested in conservation, ecological data science and data visualization.
